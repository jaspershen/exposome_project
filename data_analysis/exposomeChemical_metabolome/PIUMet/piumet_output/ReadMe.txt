What are the output of PIUMet?
For a parameter set of w, beta and mu, PIUMet provides the following results:
1.	Result_summary: a summary of input files and the resulting network
2.	output_network.html: an HTML file that shows the visualization of the resulting network (when zooming in, the name of each node and associated robustness score will display)
3.	Result_union_net: a binary interaction file
4.	Result_node_frq: Node attribute file, includes information about each node, such as their robustness score
5.	Result_edge_frq: Edge attribute file, includes information about each edge, such as their robustness score, as well as confidence score from their source database
6.	peaks_putative_metabolites: information about the peaks in the resulting network, their matched metabolites, the score they are matched to the peak, and more info about the metabolites
7.	result_AllMatched_Met: include all the matched metabolites to the input metabolite peaks, and additional information about each metabolite
